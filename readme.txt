//Create a new folder called redux in the src directory. Inside the redux folder, create a file named store.js:
// src/redux/store.js
//In the redux folder, create another folder named reducers. Inside reducers, create a file named index.js:
// src/redux/reducers/index.js
//Now, update the src/index.js to provide the Redux store to your app:
// src/index.js
//Create a new file named Todo.js in the src directory:
// src/Todo.js
//Finally, update your App.js to include the Todo component:
